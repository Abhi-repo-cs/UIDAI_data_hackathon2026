\## 1. Purpose of This System



The decision-support system called Aadhar Niranthar operates separately from monitoring dashboards.



UIDAI uses this system to achieve three main goals which include detecting early signs of Aadhaar service interruptions and selecting preventive actions for highest priority and taking preventive measures before citizens face exclusion.



The system operates without any automated decision-making capabilities.



The system establishes human decision frameworks which operate through predictive risk indicators.

\## 2. Decision Ownership Map



| Decision Level | Actor | How They Use This Output | Frequency |



|---------------|-------|--------------------------|-----------|



| Strategic | UIDAI HQ (Operations \&amp; Policy) | Identify national and inter-state risk patterns; allocate intervention budgets | Quarterly |



| Tactical | State Registrars | Prioritize districts for targeted drives and capacity balancing | Monthly |



| Operational | District Administrators / EC Managers | Plan biometric update drives, school-linked initiatives, and surge handling | Monthly / Ad-hoc |



Each organizational level processes the same performance indicators through its own unique perspective.



The system allows vertical organization of data but it does not create exact copies of existing data.

\## 3. Metric-to-Action Trigger Framework



\### 3.1 Service Resilience Index (SRI)



The signal indicates how well service infrastructure systems can handle unexpected changes in their required capacity.



| SRI Category | Interpretation | Triggered Action |



|-------------|---------------|-----------------|



The system handles demand changes without problems which requires standard monitoring activities.



The system struggles to handle sudden demand increases so organizations should establish emergency plans while keeping track of system performance through monthly assessments.



The system faces an imminent threat of service overload so organizations need to perform capacity distribution adjustments together with forward-looking deployment actions.



SRI does not mandate action alone.



The process functions as a readiness assessment tool.



---



\### 3.2 Continuity Break Risk (CBR)



The signal serves to identify when the Aadhaar system will stop working because biometric data fails to update on schedule during its operational life cycle.



| CBR Band | Interpretation | Triggered Action |



|---------|----------------|-----------------|



The system operates without any interruptions so there is no need for any corrective measures.



The risk development requires organizations to begin their first communication activities for reaching out to others.



The system needs biometric update drives to handle the elevated exclusion risk which requires specialized operational units.



The system requires emergency unified response teams to stop its upcoming operational breakdown.



CBR functions as the main prevention system which activates all other security measures.

\### 3.3 Intervention Priority Ranking (IPR)



What it signals:  



The UIDAI selection process stops the greatest number of future exclusion events from occurring.



| IPR Action | Meaning |



|-----------|---------|



| Monitor | Observe trends; no immediate intervention |



| Intervene | Schedule preventive action within 1–3 months |



| Escalate | Immediate coordination across levels required |



The IPR system helps organizations manage their limited resources through decision-making processes which solve trade-off situations.

\## 4. No-Action Consequence Framing



The system will detect dangerous threats which operators ignore because they allow six to twelve months to pass before taking action.



\- Biometric systems fail to match users at rising rates without any public notification



\- The system blocks authentication for users when their age reaches a certain point which prevents them from accessing their accounts



\- The system presents welfare service breakdowns as technical system problems instead of showing actual policy deficiencies



\- The process of taking corrective measures leads to rising expenses which simultaneously harm the organization's public image



The system changes the way it shows expenses by swapping the term:



\&gt; “Cost of intervention”  



for  



\&gt; “Cost of inaction.”

\## 5. Governance \&amp; Ethics Safeguards



\- All analysis is performed on aggregated, non-identifiable data



\- No individual Aadhaar records are accessed or inferred



\- The system uses population-based indicators to create risk models which show how risks develop during their entire lifecycle.



\- The system produces advisory outputs which do not carry out automated enforcement actions



\- Human beings need to make all decisions at each stage of the decision-making process



The system operates according to all rules which protect personal data and its particular uses.



---

\## 6. Pilot Readiness



This system can be piloted without policy change by:



\- Running monthly on existing UIDAI datasets



\- Reviewing outputs in existing operational meetings



\- Using it alongside current dashboards as a preventive layer



The Atlas complements, not replaces, existing monitoring tools.



---



\## 7. What Makes This Different



Unlike standard Aadhaar analytics, this system:



\- Predicts time-to-failure, not past stress



\- Focuses on continuity, not availability



\- Produces ranked, explainable decisions



\- Integrates governance logic from the start



This is a decision system, not a visualization exercise.
