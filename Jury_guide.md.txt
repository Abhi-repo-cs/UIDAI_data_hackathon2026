# Jury Guide
## Aadhaar Niranthar

This guide is intended to help evaluators quickly understand:
- What problem this project actually solves
- How it differs from standard Aadhaar analytics
- Where to focus attention for assessment

---

## 1. What Problem This Project Solves (In One Line)

This project identifies **where Aadhaar continuity is likely to fail next**, not where it failed in the past — and prioritizes preventive action before citizens experience exclusion.

---

## 2. How to Read This Project (Suggested Order)

If you have limited time, we recommend the following order:

### Step 1 — Executive Summary (`README.md`)
- Understand the problem framing
- Note the shift from availability to continuity
- Focus on the *forward-looking* nature of the system

### Step 2 — Decision Readiness (`DECISION_READINESS.md`)
- Review how outputs translate into UIDAI actions
- Note the decision ownership map and trigger framework
- This section reflects policy and operational maturity

### Step 3 — Core Visuals (`/images` or `/visualizations`)
- Each visual answers a specific decision question
- Titles are phrased as policy or operational queries
- Visuals are designed to support action, not exploration

### Step 4 — Analytical Logic (`src/indices/`)
- Review `service_resilience_index.py` (SRI)
- Review `continuity_break_risk.py` (CBR)
- Review `intervention_priority.py` (IPR)
- Emphasis is on explainability and governance safety

## 3. What Makes This Different From Typical Hackathon Entries

Most Aadhaar-related analyses:
- Describe historical stress or backlog
- Focus on volume or infrastructure presence
- End with generic recommendations

This project deliberately avoids that pattern by:
- Modeling **time-to-continuity-failure**
- Measuring **resilience**, not just load
- Producing **ranked, explainable intervention priorities**
- Integrating governance and ethics from the design stage

This is a **decision-support system**, not a dashboard.

---

## 4. How to Evaluate Technical Rigor

Evaluators may wish to note that:
- All inputs are aggregated UIDAI datasets
- No individual-level inference is performed
- No opaque or black-box models are used
- All composite scores enforce explicit weight validation
- Configuration (thresholds, weights) is externalized for policy control

Technical choices prioritize **defensibility and interpretability** over complexity.

---

## 5. How to Evaluate Policy Applicability

This project is designed to be piloted without:
- New data collection
- Policy change
- Automation of enforcement

It complements existing UIDAI dashboards by adding a **preventive layer** focused on continuity risk.

---

## 6. What This Project Is Not Claiming

This system does not claim to:
- Predict individual Aadhaar failure
- Replace UIDAI operational judgment
- Provide deterministic forecasts

All outputs are **risk signals**, intended to support human decision-making.

---

## 7. Final Note to Evaluators

If this project feels less like a hackathon demo and more like an operational pilot proposal, that is intentional.

The design goal was not to maximize visual novelty, but to maximize **decision readiness, credibility, and preventive impact**.
